<p><B>PLOT</B><br>
Mr. Robot follows Elliot, a young programmer who works as a cyber-security engineer by day <br>
and as a vigilante hacker by night. Elliot finds himself at a crossroads when the mysterious <br>
leader of an underground hacker group recruits him to destroy the firm he is paid to protect. <br>
Compelled by his personal beliefs, Elliot struggles to resist the chance to take down the <br>
multinational CEOs he believes are running (and ruining) the world. Eventually, he realizes <br>
that a global conspiracy does exist, but not the one he expected.</p>
